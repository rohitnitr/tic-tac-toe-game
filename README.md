# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install tkinter numpy
```

4. Run the game by executing the Python script:

```bash
python game.py
```

## How to Play

The game interface will open in a new window. The players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the grid to place their symbols. Player 1 uses the symbol X, and Player 2 uses the symbol O.

Once a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed indicating the result. You can click anywhere on the window to play again.

## Game Controls

- Left-click: Place the current player's symbol on an empty cell.
- Reset button: Resets the game and the scores.

## Features

- Random background color for each game.
- Keeps track of scores for Player 1 (X), Player 2 (O), and ties.
- Allows players to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.
- Dynamic grid size and symbol placement based on the window size.
